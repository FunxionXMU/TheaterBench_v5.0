    "reasoning_trace": "I initially considered someone simply eating a strawberry, but that lacks narrative engagement. I then thought about a pastry chef decorating a tart, which is better but perhaps too professional. I settled on a relatable home kitchen scenario: washing strawberries. This allows for a dynamic physical interaction where water pressure causes a strawberry to 'escape' the bowl, creating a small, realistic moment of minor chaos and reaction.\nThe original start shows a person about to wash strawberries, and the end shows them reacting to a strawberry that has escaped the bowl. To introduce a surreal twist that remains consistent with these markers, I replaced the physical bounce of the fruit with an impossible action: the strawberry sprouts tiny, fluttering wings to avoid the water stream and flies across the counter.",
    "synopsis": "While preparing to wash a bowl of strawberries, one of the berries spontaneously develops wings and flies away from the running water, forcing the person to chase after it.",

    "reviewer_audit": {
      "passed": true,
      "reason": "The script perfectly adheres to the [Setup -> Twist -> Reaction] structure. The START (0-3s) is pure setup, showing the person preparing to wash the strawberries. The MIDDLE (3-7s) contains a clear and surreal twist: a strawberry sprouts wings and flies away. The END (7-10s) shows a simple, direct reaction to the twist: turning off the water and reaching for the strawberry. The transitions are logical and continuous.",
