The synopsis describes a supernatural event where the wands drag the plane and the tarmac physically bunches up like a rug. However, the actual end frame shows a completely standard, realistic scene of a plane taxiing toward a marshal. The tarmac is flat and wet with normal reflections, and there is no visual evidence of the 'supernatural force' or the 'bunched up' ground mentioned in the synopsis. Furthermore, the provided 'Expected Conclusion' description (plane halting, engines whining down) also contradicts the supernatural elements described in the synopsis. The actual end frame matches the 'Expected Conclusion' text but fails to reflect the core events of the synopsis.",
