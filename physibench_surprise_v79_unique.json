Idea 1 is a bit too mundane for a visual scene; Idea 2 provides a more dynamic and engaging sequence of events while remaining perfectly realistic and relatable.\nThe original sequence involves a bag of potatoes tearing and the contents spilling out normally. To introduce a surreal element while maintaining the narrative coherence of the start and end, I transformed the falling motion into a defiant act of gravity. Instead of merely tumbling, the potatoes emerge from the rip and begin to hover and dance in an impossible mid-air formation before finally settling on the floor, adding a layer of the absurd to a mundane household accident.",

Idea 3 is chosen because it depicts a relatable, realistic interaction with roller skates that provides visual tension and movement without being overly extreme.\nThe original scene describes the skater's legs drifting apart and him flailing for balance.

Instead of simply dabbing a liquid, the alcohol manifests as a miniature lightning storm.
