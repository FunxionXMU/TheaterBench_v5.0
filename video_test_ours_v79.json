This indicates intense, direct sunlight is entering through the window.\n2. **Action (3-7s):** The person reaches out with their right hand and pulls a heavy, dark-colored fabric curtain across the window. The motion is consistent with pulling a curtain from one side to the other.\n3. **Final State (7-10s):** The room is now in shadow, and the person is no longer shielding their eyes.

The action shown is a physical pull, not a button press.\n*   **D** is a fantastical and physically impossible action, not a realistic depiction of how light is blocked.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only one that accurately describes the real-world action taking place in the video.",
