The man is seen reaching for the microphone, and in the very next shot, the microphone has transformed into a creature with a wide-open mouth, which is the source of the sound that causes him to react.

Option A describes a realistic event (audio feedback), but the microphone does not change form. Option C describes a physical collapse, which is not what happens.

This matches option C, which describes the triangle liquifying into a shimmering ripple of silver light that distorts the air. The other options describe more conventional musical actions (e.g., striking the triangle normally), but the visual effects in the video are clearly stylized and magical, not realistic.",
