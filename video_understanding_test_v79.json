The most logical explanation for his subsequent reaction is that the microphone itself changed in a startling way. Option B describes this perfectly: the microphone transforms into a creature with a mouth that screams, which would cause the man to recoil and cover his ear.

In the 3-7s interval, the triangle is struck (evidenced by the glowing visual effect representing vibration), which aligns with Option B's description of a \"swift, precise strike to the side of the triangle\" producing a resonant tone. Option A is incorrect because triangles are typically struck on the side, not the inner bottom bar. Option C describes a fantastical, non-realistic event (metal liquefying), which does not match the video’s realistic orchestral context. Option D is incorrect as triangles do not use hanging strings for tension adjustment, and the video shows a single strike, not a tremolo effect.
