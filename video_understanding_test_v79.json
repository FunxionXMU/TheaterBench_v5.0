The final segment (7-10s) shows him recoiling in pain and covering his ear, looking towards the sound booth. This reaction is a direct response to a sudden, loud, and unpleasant sound originating from the microphone. Option B is the only one that provides a coherent and logical explanation for this sequence: the man touches the microphone, which then transforms into a creature that emits a piercing scream, causing him to recoil. The other options are implausible: A involves a violent explosion that would likely cause more than just a recoil; C describes a common feedback screech, but the man's reaction is one of physical pain and shock, not just annoyance; D describes a massive light and sound event that would have a much more dramatic and widespread effect than what is shown.
