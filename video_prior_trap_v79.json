The most plausible cause for this reaction is audio feedback—a loud, piercing screech caused by the microphone picking up its own amplified sound. Option C directly describes this scenario: the man adjusting the mic (gripping the neck) triggers feedback, which matches the physical reaction (covering the ear) and the context of a live event. The other options involve implausible supernatural or catastrophic events (shattering glass, transforming mic, blinding flash) that don't align with the man's specific reaction to sound.

The man’s subsequent reaction (wincing, recoiling, covering his ear) is consistent with being startled by a sudden, loud, and unnatural sound from the transformed mic. Options A, C, and D describe implausible or mismatched events: A involves shattering glass (not seen), C describes audio feedback (no physical transformation), and D involves a glowing light (not present).

The 7-10s interval shows him dampening the vibration and exhaling relief, confirming the triangle was struck and produced sound.

Option B accurately describes a standard orchestral action: waiting for a conductor's cue, striking the side of the triangle (the correct technique for producing a resonant tone), and resulting in a 'crystalline tone' that echoes. This aligns with the realistic, formal context of the video. Option A is incorrect because triangles are struck on the side, not the 'inner bottom bar' (a non-standard term that misrepresents the instrument's structure). Option C is fantastical and inconsistent with real-world physics. Option D is invalid as triangles have no strings to adjust tension.
